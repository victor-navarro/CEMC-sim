# CEMC-sim
R-based simulator of the Common elements model of object categorization learning

The Common elements model of object categorization learning ([Soto & Wasserman, 2010](http://people.psych.ucsb.edu/soto/fabian/docs/PR.10.sw.pdf)) uses stimulus sampling theory, a R-W learning rule, and a softmax rule to model concept learning in natural categories.

I programmed in R (as a side project in an introductory course in R), and used it to simulate results in an (hopefully) upcoming publication. Feel free to use and fork this project if you want.

Cheers!
